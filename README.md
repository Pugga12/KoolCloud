# KoolKode
A password-free Scratch 1.4 mod entirely coded in SqueakJS. To use this mod, go to https://squeak.js.org/run/, drag-and-drop KoolKode.image, and then go to https://squeak.js.org/run/#image=/KoolKode.image to launch it.

Proud to be one of the only people actively developing a Scratch 1.4 mod right now!

NOTE: KOOLKODE IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH SCRATCH, OF THE MIT MEDIA LAB.
