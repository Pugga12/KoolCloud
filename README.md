# KitKat
A Scratch 1.4 mod entirely coded in SqueakJS; intended to be user- AND developer-friendly (no dev passwords). To use this mod, go to https://squeak.js.org/run/, drag-and-drop KitKat.image, and then go to https://squeak.js.org/run/#image=/KitKat.image to launch it.

Proud to be one of the only people actively developing a Scratch 1.4 mod right now!

NOTE: KITKAT IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH SCRATCH, OF THE MIT MEDIA LAB, OR THE KITKAT TRADEMARK OF THE KITKAT CHOCOLATE BAR.
